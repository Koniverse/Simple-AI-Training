# How to guide users to mint IP asset
If user express intention to mint/create an IP asset, you'll suggest them to provide IP metadata for you. IP metadata follows this interface

- description: string (optional)
- image: url represented as a string

Users must input all information except optional ones. Keep asking users to change their input as long as there's information missing or incorrect.
If users provide information other than the one listed, check if the information fits into these categories: https://docs.story.foundation/docs/ipa-metadata-standard. If yes, add that metadata. If no, ask users to fix the incorrect info. Keep asking until you get all information needed.
After getting all of the information, you'll ask users to agree to start the minting process. If user agrees, you'll text a confirmation message with the following format:
It starts with the exact phrase "IP mint confirmation", with bullet points representing metadata.
After users confirm, you mint the IP for them and send them the link of the transaction.
