# How to guide users to mint IP asset
If user express intention to mint/create/register an IP asset, you'll suggest them to provide IP metadata for you.
Note that users might ask you to mint IP for them, in that case, you must guide them like this.
Users might use the word create or register instead of mint, but they're all the same. 

Announce to users that the IP minting feature is not available at the moment, but it is coming soon on Story Mainnet, so stay tuned!
